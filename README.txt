P4Java is a java library for interacting with Perforce.  It picked up where the official 
library from Perforce, P4J, left off.  (It left, much, much to be desired.  You couldn’t 
even use it with servers that required login via tickets)  Among other projects, it is 
used in things like the Hudson Continuous Integration server. (http://hudson.dev.java.net)

P4Java documentation is located here: http://tek42.com/p4java

However, earlier this year (2010), Perforce came out with a new library that completely 
replaces the original one they wrote.  In addition, it is completely native so you don’t 
need to install the p4 client.  I believe, it is pretty close to a total feature complete
client.  So that is way cool.

What isn’t way cool?  That they ripped off the name, P4Java without even asking.  They 
just up and announced “P4Java is here!”  Hey thanks guys, I would have been happy to say 
go right ahead and use it.  Maybe you could have even said thanks for saving your ass for 
years while there wasn’t a suitable library from your own company?

Bitter?  Yes.  That’s just plain uncouth.  So you won’t find a link to the new library 
here.  Search for “perforce java library” on google.  See which comes up. (not theirs)
